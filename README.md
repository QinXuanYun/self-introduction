# self-introduction
Hello,I'm an ordinary high school student from ShangHai, China.</br>

All my repositories are used to review what I learned in school and explore something new for me.</br>

)))Because our IT teacher's lectures are smelly and long.</br>
(我们信息科技老师讲课又臭又长。)</br>

Hers teaching let students feel sleepy and let us don't want to listen to it at all, she doesn't give examples in the key content, ask questions directly, and say "isn't it difficult"))) Although this is a common problem of some teachers.</br>
(她讲课让人很想睡觉，根本不想听，重点内容不举例，直接提问，还问 ”不难吧“）））虽然这是一些老师的通病了。)</br>

So I want to use Github to record what I learned and to preview what I'm going to learn.</br>

And then I can do other homework or sleep on her class.
